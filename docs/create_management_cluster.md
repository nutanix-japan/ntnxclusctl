## Workstation Setup

We will need a Kubernetes cluster setup on our workstation. This could be any of the following:

- Kind
- Minikube
- k3d
  
During testing on a Intel Macbook pro with 8 CPU and 16 CPU, we found out that ``kind`` cluster performed the best.

Please feel free to choose what you are familiar with and have proven sucess with.

!!!warning
          We have noticed the following issues when we were running kubernetes clusters on local Mac/Windows

          - Pods on ``kube-system`` namespace may take about 10 minutes to download
          - Pods may take about 5 minutes to become ``Ready`` state
          - Make sure the management cluster is fully functional before proceeding to creating workload cluster

## Create Management Cluster

Follow steps here to [create](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) a ``kind`` mangement cluster 

## Initialise Management Cluster 

1. Create the following file in your workstation 
    
    ```bash
    vi ~/.cluster-api/clusterctl.yaml
    ```

2. Fill in the following contents

    ```bash
    NUTANIX_ENDPOINT: ""     # IP or FQDN of Prism Central
    NUTANIX_USER: "admin"             # Prism Central user
    NUTANIX_PASSWORD: ""    # Prism Central password
    NUTANIX_INSECURE: true
    EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: true    # Experimental for testing CCM and Autoscaling
    EXP_MACHINE_POOL: "true"          # Experimental
    CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: "true"          # Experimental
    
    KUBERNETES_VERSION: "v1.24.7"
    WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT: 3
    NUTANIX_MACHINE_VCPU_SOCKET: 4
    NUTANIX_MACHINE_MEMORY_SIZE: "8Gi"
    NUTANIX_SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEY: ""
    
    NUTANIX_PRISM_ELEMENT_CLUSTER_NAME: ""
    NUTANIX_MACHINE_TEMPLATE_IMAGE_NAME: "ubuntu-2204-kube-v1.24.11"
    NUTANIX_SUBNET_NAME: "Primary"
    ```

3. Instantiate the Cluster API to communicate with Nutanix Cluster

    ```bash
    clusterctl init -i nutanix
    ```
4. Make sure all pods are in a Running and healthy state in the following namespaces:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n capi-system
    kubectl get pods -n capx-system
    kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
    ```

    !!!warning
           If pods in the above name spaces are not running or have any errors, troubleshoot your CAPX deployment on management cluster.
